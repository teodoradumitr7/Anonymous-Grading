# Anonymous-Grading
The aim of the project is to create a web application that allows anonymous grades to be given by a series of students chosen according to a random criterion to the projects of other students. The platform is based on a web application with Single Page Application architecture accessible in a browser on desktop, mobile devices or tablets.
As a student I can add a project. Upon registration, I automatically become part of the group of evaluators. When adding a project, I can set the title, a description, a link to a demonstration video or the github account. I can give a grade to the project only if I was selected in the jury for it according to the random criterion. The grade on a project is anonymous, and the total grade is calculated by omitting the highest and lowest grade. If at least 2 grades were not added, this will be calculated without omitting the minimum and maximum. The grades are from 1-10. As a teacher, I can see the details and means for the projects, but not the identity of the jury members.
